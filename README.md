# Artificial Intelligence Mathematics Olympiad (AIMO)

## Overview
This repository contains notebooks and resources for the Artificial Intelligence Mathematics Olympiad (AIMO), a Kaggle competition focused on training large language models (LLMs) to solve complex math problems. This competition challenged participants to push the boundaries of AI capabilities in mathematical reasoning and problem-solving.

---

## Project Highlights
- **Advanced LLM Techniques**: Explored state-of-the-art techniques for training and fine-tuning LLMs.

- **Mathematical Reasoning**: Focused on solving math problems, ranging from algebra to calculus and beyond.

- **Efficiency & Optimization**: Leveraged cutting-edge tools like Transformers and Accelerate to maximize model performance.

## Notebooks
The repository includes:
1. **aimo-llm-class-deepseek**: This notebook implements the standard pipeline for initializing LLM and running the inference on solving math problems provided by AIMO.

2. **deepseek-class-rag-question**: This notebook implements the RAG (Retrieval-augmented generation) method in order to help the LLM solve the math problems.
